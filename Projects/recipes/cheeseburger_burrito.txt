Ingredients
3000g beef mince
7.5 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
8 tbsp ketchup
8 tbsp mustard
1 tbsp salt
1 tsp black pepper
500g fat-free Greek yoghurt
500g full-fat Greek yoghurt

Method
In a bowl, add all the dairy products with 4 tbsp of ketchup and 4 tbsp of mustard. Mix thoroughly. Place in fridge.
In a sealable container, add Worcestershire sauce, remaining ketchup and mustard, salt, and black pepper. Seal and shake to mix.
Fry the beef mince in batches. Add a few tbsp of the sauce to each batch while cooking. Leave some sauce for later.
Transfer each cooked batch into a large bowl.
Pour the remaining sauce onto the cooked mince. Mix thoroughly.
Take the cheese sauce from the fridge and add it to the mince. Mix thoroughly.
Heat a non-stick pan to medium.
Microwave 3 wraps at a time for 20 seconds to soften.
Place 1/24th of the mixture onto each wrap. Wrap tightly and place seam side down in the pan. Fry until browned.
Repeat for all 24 wraps.
Once cooled, wrap each in tinfoil and freeze.
